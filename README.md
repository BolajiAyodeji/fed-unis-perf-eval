# fed-unis-perf-eval

The aim of this study is to evaluate the accessibility and performance of the official websites of the forty-nine (49) accredited Federal Universities in Nigeria by using the Google Lighthouse web auditing tool.

The auditing is performed using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and the [lighthouse-batch](https://github.com/mikestead/lighthouse-batch) library. Kindly note the following:

- The generated report for each university is available in JSON, HTML, and CSV formats.
- The generated report for each university can be found in the `/lighthouse report/<university name>` directory.
- The generated summary report for each university can be found in the [`summary.json`](./summary.json) file (view the RAW format [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BolajiAyodeji/fed-unis-perf-eval/main/summary.json)).
- The concluding report data for the research can be found in the [`summary.csv`](.summary.csv) file.
